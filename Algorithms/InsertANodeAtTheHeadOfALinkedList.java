/**
 * Youâ€™re given the pointer to the head node of a linked list and an integer to
 * add to the list. Create a new node with the given integer, insert this node
 * at the head of the linked list and return the new head node. The head pointer
 * given may be null meaning that the initial list is empty.
 * 
 * Input Format You have to complete the Node* Insert(Node* head, int data)
 * method which takes two arguments - the head of the linked list and the
 * integer to insert. You should NOT read any input from stdin/console.
 * 
 * Output Format Insert the new node at the head and return the head of the
 * updated linked list. Do NOT print anything to stdout/console.
 * 
 * Sample Input
 * 
 * NULL , data = 1 1 --> NULL , data = 2
 * 
 * Sample Output
 * 
 * 1 --> NULL 2 --> 1 --> NULL Explanation 1. We have an empty list, on
 * inserting 1, 1 becomes new head. 2. We have a list with 1 as head, on
 * inserting 2, 2 becomes the new head.
