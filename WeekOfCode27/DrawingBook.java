/**
 * our submission will run against only preliminary test cases. Full test cases
 * will run at the end of the day. Brieâ€™s Drawing teacher asks her class to open
 * their -page book to page number . Brie can either start turning pages from
 * the front of the book (i.e., page number ) or from the back of the book
 * (i.e., page number ), and she always turns pages one-by-one (as opposed to
 * skipping through multiple pages at once). When she opens the book, page is
 * always on the right side:
 * 
 * image
 * 
 * Each page in the book has two sides, front and back, except for the last page
 * which may only have a front side depending on the total number of pages of
 * the book (see the Explanation sections below for additional diagrams).
 * 
 * Given and , find and print the minimum number of pages Brie must turn in
 * order to arrive at page .
 * 
 * Input Format
 * 
 * The first line contains an integer, , denoting the number of pages in the
 * book. The second line contains an integer, , denoting the page that Brie's
 * teacher wants her to turn to.
